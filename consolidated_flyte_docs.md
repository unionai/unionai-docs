# Community

Flyte is an open source project that is built and maintained by a community of contributors.
Union AI is the primary maintainer of Flyte and developer of Union.ai, a closed source commercial product that is built on top of Flyte.

Since the success of Flyte is essential to the success of Union.ai,
the company is dedicated to building and expanding the Flyte open source project and community.

For information on how to get involved and how to keep in touch, see [Joining the community](joining-the-community.md).

## Contributing to the codebase

The full Flyte codebase is open source and available on GitHub.
If you are interested, see [Contributing code](contributing-code.md).

## Contributing to documentation

Union AI maintains and hosts both Flyte and Union documentation at [www.union.ai/docs](/docs/v2/root/).
The two sets of documentation are deeply integrated, as the Union product is built on top of Flyte.
To better maintain both sets of docs, they are hosted in the same repository (but rendered so that you can choose to view one or the other).

Both the Flyte and Union documentation are open source.
Flyte community members and Union customers are both welcome to contribute to the documentation.

If you are interested, see [Contributing documentation and examples](./contributing-docs/_index).
