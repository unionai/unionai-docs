# Flyte

> Flyte is a free and open source platform for orchestrating AI workflows. Flyte empowers AI development teams to rapidly ship high-quality code to production by offering optimized performance, unparalleled resource efficiency, and a delightful workflow authoring experience. Union.ai offers commercial products built on Flyte: BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud), Self-managed, and Serverless.

Important notes:

- Flyte 2.0 (currently in beta) represents a fundamental shift in how AI workflows are written and executed, with pure Python execution, a simplified API, and fine-grained reproducibility.
- The Flyte SDK uses Python 3.10+ and integrates with the `uv` package manager.
- Tasks are defined within `TaskEnvironment` objects, which encapsulate the context and resources needed for execution.
- There is no `@workflow` decorator in Flyte 2—"workflows" are authored through a pattern of tasks calling tasks.
- Union.ai provides commercial variants with additional features like reusable containers and multi-cluster support.
