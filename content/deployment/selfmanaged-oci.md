# Data plane setup on OCI

{{< key product_name >}}’s modular architecture allows for great flexibility and control.
The customer can decide how many clusters to have, their shape, and who has access to what.
All communication is encrypted.
The Union architecture is described on the [Architecture](./architecture/_index) page.

## Assumptions

* You have a {{< key product_name >}} organization, and you know the control plane URL for your organization.
* You have a cluster name provided by or coordinated with Union.
* You have a Kubernetes cluster, running one of the most recent three minor Kubernetes versions.
  [Learn more](https://kubernetes.io/releases/version-skew-policy/).
* You have configured a storage bucket.
* You have configured your OKE cluster as indicated in [Cluster Recommendations](./cluster-recommendations).

## Prerequisites

* Install [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
* Install [uctl](../api-reference/uctl-cli/_index).

## Deploy the {{< key product_name >}} operator

1. Add the {{< key product_name >}} Helm repo:

   ```bash
   helm repo add unionai https://unionai.github.io/helm-charts/
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Use the `uctl selfserve provision-dataplane-resources` command to generate a new client and client secret for communicating with your Union control plane, provision authorization permissions for the app to operate on the union cluster name you have selected, generate values file to install dataplane in your Kubernetes cluster and provide follow-up instructions:

   ```bash
   uctl config init --host=<YOUR_UNION_CONTROL_PLANE_URL>
   uctl selfserve provision-dataplane-resources --clusterName <YOUR_SELECTED_CLUSTERNAME>  --provider oci
   ```

   * The command will output the ID, name, and a secret that will be used by the Union services to communicate with your control plane.
     It will also generate a YAML file specific to the provider that you specify, in this case `oci`.

   * Save the secret that is displayed. Union does not store the credentials; rerunning the same command can be used to retrieve the secret later.

3. Update the generated values file with your OCI storage and access key details.

4. Optionally configure the resource `limits` and `requests` for the different services.
   By default, these will be set minimally, will vary depending on usage, and follow the Kubernetes `ResourceRequirements` specification.

   * `clusterresourcesync.resources`
   * `flytepropeller.resources`
   * `flytepropellerwebhook.resources`
   * `operator.resources`
   * `proxy.resources`

5. Install the data plane Helm chart:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install union unionai/dataplane \
     -f <GENERATED_VALUES_FILE> \
     --namespace union \
     --create-namespace
   ```

6. Create an API key for your organization. This is required for v2 workflow executions on the data plane. If you have already created one, rerun the same command to propagate the key to the new cluster:

   ```bash
   uctl create apikey --keyName EAGER_API_KEY --org <YOUR_ORG_NAME>
   ```

7. Once deployed you can check to see if the cluster has been successfully registered to the control plane:

   ```bash
   uctl get cluster
    ----------- ------- --------------- -----------
   | NAME      | ORG   | STATE         | HEALTH    |
    ----------- ------- --------------- -----------
   | <cluster> | <org> | STATE_ENABLED | HEALTHY   |
    ----------- ------- --------------- -----------
   1 rows
   ```

8. You can then register and run some example workflows through your cluster to ensure that it is working correctly.

   ```bash
   uctl register examples --project=union-health-monitoring --domain=development
   uctl validate snacks --project=union-health-monitoring --domain=development
