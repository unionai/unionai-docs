# Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)

To set up your {{< key product_name >}} instance to use Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider, follow the directions below.

> [!NOTE] Microsoft documentation
> In this article, we cover the same steps as the
> [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) Microsoft documentation, but with additional directions specific
> to {{< key product_name >}}.

## Register an Entra ID application

1. Log into your Azure account as a cloud application administrator or higher permission level.

1. In the identity drop down on the top right of the page (indicated by the email you are currently logged in as) select **Switch directory**, then select the directory yin which you want to register this application.

1. Browse to **Identity > Applications > App registrations** and select **New registration**.

1. Under **Name**, enter an appropriate display name. For example, `{{< key product_name >}} Production`.

1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.

1. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web** and enter the following URI:

   `https://signin.hosted.unionai.cloud/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback`

1. Click **Register**.

> [!NOTE] Make the app visible to users
> New app registrations are hidden to users by default. You must enable the app when you are ready for
> users to see the app on their **My Apps** page.
> To enable the app, in the Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate to
> **Identity > Applications > Enterprise > applications** and select the app.
> Then, on the **Properties** page, toggle **Visible to users?** to **Yes**.

## Copy the values needed by the {{< key product_name >}} team

When registration finishes, the Microsoft Entra admin center will display the app registration's **Overview** page, from which you can copy the Application (client) ID, Directory (tenant) ID, and client secret needed by the {{< key product_name >}} team.

### Application (client) ID and directory (tenant) ID

Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** from the overview page to a text file on your computer.

### Client secret

To get the **client secret**, on the overview page, go to **Client credentials** and click **Add a certificate or secret**.

Copy the **Value** of this secret to a plain text file on your computer.

## Share the client secret securely with {{< key product_name >}}

1. Copy the public key provided by {{< key product_name >}} here:
   {{< download "/_static/public/public-key.txt" "public-key.txt" >}}

2. Go to [https://pgptool.org](https://pgptool.org/).

3. Click the **Encrypt** tab.

4. Upload the public key provided by {{< key product_name >}} under **Receiver's public key**.

5. Skip the **Signer’s Private Key** section.

6. Enter the **client secret** in plain text and encrypt it.

7. Download the encrypted text and share it with the {{< key product_name >}} team over Slack.

8. Delete the **client secret** from the text file on your computer.

## Share the IDs with {{< key product_name >}}

Share the **application (client) ID** and **directory (tenant) ID** with the {{< key product_name >}} team over Slack.
These values do not have to be encrypted.
