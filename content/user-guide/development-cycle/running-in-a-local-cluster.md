# Running in a local cluster

## Running in a local Kubernetes cluster

Ultimately you will be running your workflows in a Kubernetes cluster in {{< key product_name >}}. But it can be handy to try out a workflow in a cluster on your local machine.

First, ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or a similar OCI-compliant container engine) installed locally and that _the daemon is running_.

Then start the demo cluster using `{{< key ctl >}}`:

```shell
$ {{< key ctl >}} demo start
```

### Configuration

When `{{< key ctl >}}` starts the cluster in your local container engine it also writes configuration information to the directory `~/.{{< key product >}}/`.

Most importantly, it creates the file `~/.{{< key product >}}/config-sandbox.yaml`. This file holds (among other things) the location of the Kubernetes cluster to which we will be deploying the workflow:

```yaml
admin:
  endpoint: localhost:30080
  authType: Pkce
  insecure: true
console:
  endpoint: http://localhost:30080
logger:
  show-source: true
  level: 0
```

Right now this file indicates that the target cluster is your local Docker instance (`localhost:30080`), but later we will change it to point to your {{< key product_name >}} cluster.

Later invocations of `{{< key ctl >}}` or `{{< key cli >}}` will need to know the location of the target cluster. This can be provided in two ways:

1. Explicitly passing the location of the config file on the command line
   * `{{< key ctl >}} --config ~/.{{< key product >}}/config-sandbox.yaml <command>`
   * `{{< key cli >}} --config ~/.{{< key product >}}/config-sandbox.yaml <command>`
2. Setting the environment variable `{{< key config_env >}}`to the location of the config file:
   * `export {{< key config_env >}}=~/.{{< key product >}}/config-sandbox.yaml`

> [!NOTE]
> In this guide, we assume that you have set the `{{< key config_env >}}` environment variable in your shell to the location of the configuration file.

### Start the workflow

Now you can run your workflow in the local cluster simply by adding the `--remote` flag to your `{{< key cli >}}` command:

```shell
$ {{< key cli >}} run --remote \
          workflows/example.py \
          training_workflow \
          --hyperparameters '{"C": 0.1}'
```

The output supplies a URL to your workflow execution in the UI.

### Inspect the results

Navigate to the URL produced by `{{< key cli >}} run` to see your workflow in the {{< key product_name >}} UI.

## Local cluster with default image

```shell
$ {{< key cli >}} run --remote my_file.py my_workflow
```

_Where `{{< key cli >}}` is configured to point to the local cluster started with `{{< key ctl >}} demo start`._

* Task code runs in the environment of the default image in your local cluster.
* Python code is dynamically overlaid into the container at runtime.
* Only supports Python code whose dependencies are installed in the default image (see here).
* Includes a local S3.
* Supports some plugins but not all.
* Single workflow runs immediately.
* Workflow is registered to a default project.
* Useful for demos.

## Local cluster with custom image

```shell
$ {{< key cli >}} run --remote \
              --image my_cr.io/my_org/my_image:latest \
              my_file.py \
              my_workflow
```

_Where `{{< key cli >}}` is configured to point to the local cluster started with `{{< key ctl >}} demo start`._

* Task code runs in the environment of your custom image (`my_cr.io/my_org/my_image:latest`) in your local cluster.
* Python code is dynamically overlaid into the container at runtime
* Supports any Python dependencies you wish, since you have full control of the image.
* Includes a local S3.
* Supports some plugins but not all.
* Single workflow runs immediately.
* Workflow is registered to a default project.
* Useful for advanced testing during the development cycle.
