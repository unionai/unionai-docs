# Viewing workflow executions

The **Executions list** shows all executions in a project and domain combination.
An execution represents a single run of all or part of a workflow (including subworkflows and individual tasks).
You can access it from the **Executions** link in the left navigation.

## Domain Settings

This section displays any domain-level settings that have been configured for this project-domain combination. They are:

* Security Context
* Labels
* Annotations
* Raw output data config
* Max parallelism

## All Executions in the Project

For each execution in this project and domain you can see the following:

* A graph of the **last 100 executions in the project**.
* **Start time**: Select to view the [individual execution](#execution-view).
* **Workflow/Task**: The [individual workflow](./viewing-workflows) or [individual task](../tasks/viewing-tasks) that ran in this execution.
* **Version**: The version of the workflow or task that ran in this execution.
* **Launch Plan**: The [Launch Plan](../launch-plans/viewing-launch-plans) that was used to launch this execution.
* **Schedule**: The schedule that was used to launch this execution (if any).
* **Execution ID**: The ID of the execution.
* **Status**: The status of the execution. One of **QUEUED**, **RUNNING**, **SUCCEEDED**, **FAILED** or **UNKNOWN**.
* **Duration**: The duration of the execution.

## Execution view

The execution view appears when you launch a workflow or task or select an already completed execution.

An execution represents a single run of all or part of a workflow (including subworkflows and individual tasks).

> [!NOTE]
> An execution usually represents the run of an entire workflow.
> But, because workflows are composed of tasks (and sometimes subworkflows) and {{< key product_name >}} caches the outputs of those independently of the workflows in which they participate, it sometimes makes sense to execute a task or subworkflow independently.

The top part of execution view provides detailed general information about the execution.

The bottom part provides three tabs displaying different aspects of the execution: **Nodes**, **Graph**, and **Timeline**.

### Nodes

The default tab within the execution view is the **Nodes** tab.
It shows a list of the {{< key product_name >}} nodes that make up this execution (A node in {{< key product_name >}} is either a task or a (sub-)workflow).

Selecting an item in the list opens the right panel showing more details of that specific node:

The top part of the side panel provides detailed information about the node as well as the **Rerun task** button.

Below that, you have the following tabs: **Executions**, **Inputs**, **Outputs**, and **Task**.

The **Executions** tab gives you details on the execution of this particular node as well as access to:

* **Task level monitoring**: You can access the [task-level monitoring](../tasks/task-hardware-environment/task-level-monitoring) information by selecting **View Utilization**.

* **Logs**: You can access logs by clicking the text under **Logs**. See [Logging](../tasks/viewing-logs).

The **Inputs**, **Outputs** tabs display the data that was passed into and out of the node, respectively.

If this node is a task (as opposed to a subworkflow) then the **Task** tab displays the Task definition structure.

### Graph

The Graph tab displays a visual representation of the execution as a directed acyclic graph:

### Timeline

The Timeline tab displays a visualization showing the timing of each task in the execution:
