# Workflows

So far in our discussion of workflows, we have focused on top-level workflows decorated with `@{{< key kit_as >}}.workflow`.
These are, in fact, more accurately termed [standard workflows](./standard-workflows) to differentiate them from the other types of workflows that exist in {{< key product_name >}}: [subworkflows](./subworkflows-and-sub-launch-plans), [dynamic workflows](./dynamic-workflows), [imperative workflows](./imperative-workflows),  and [eager workflows](./eager-workflows).

In this section, we will delve deeper into the fundamentals of all of these workflow types, including their syntax, structure, and behavior.
