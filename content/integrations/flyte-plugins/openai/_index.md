# OpenAI

Flyte can integrate with OpenAI SDKs in your Flyte workflows.
It provides drop-in replacements for OpenAI SDKs like `openai-agents` so that
you can build LLM-augmented workflows and agentic applications on Flyte.

## Install the plugin

To install the OpenAI plugin, run the following command:

```bash
pip install --pre flyteplugins-openai
```
