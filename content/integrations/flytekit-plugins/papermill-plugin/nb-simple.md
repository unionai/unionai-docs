# Simple Papermill Notebook

This notebook is used in the previous example as a `NotebookTask` to demonstrate
how to use the papermill plugin.

The cell below has the `parameters` tag, defining the inputs to the notebook.


```python
v = 3.14
```

Then, we do some computation:


```python
square = v*v
print(square)
```

Finally, we use the `flytekitplugins.papermill` package to record the outputs
so that flyte understands which state to serialize and pass into a downstream
task.


```python
from flytekitplugins.papermill  import record_outputs

record_outputs(square=square)
```
