# How to Trigger the Feast Workflow using FlyteRemote

The goal of this notebook is to train a simple [Gaussian Naive Bayes model using sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.GaussianNB.html) on a modified [Horse-Colic dataset from UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Horse+Colic).

The model aims to classify if the lesion of the horse is surgical or not.

Let's get started!

Set the AWS environment variables before importing Flytekit.


```python
import os

os.environ["FLYTE_AWS_ENDPOINT"] = os.environ["FEAST_S3_ENDPOINT_URL"] = "http://localhost:30084/"
os.environ["FLYTE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] = os.environ["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"] = "minio"
os.environ["FLYTE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] = os.environ["AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"] = "miniostorage"
```

## 01. Register the code

The actual workflow code is auto-documented and rendered using sphinx [here](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/cookbook/en/latest/auto/case_studies/feature_engineering/feast_integration/index.html). We've used [Flytekit](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytekit/en/latest/) to express the pipeline in pure Python.

You can use [FlyteConsole](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyteconsole) to launch, monitor, and introspect Flyte executions. However here, let's use [flytekit.remote](https://docs.flyte.org/projects/flytekit/en/latest/design/control_plane.html) to interact with the Flyte backend.


```python
from flytekit.remote import FlyteRemote
from flytekit.configuration import Config

# The `for_sandbox` method instantiates a connection to the demo cluster.
remote = FlyteRemote(
    config=Config.for_sandbox(),
    default_project="flytesnacks",
    default_domain="development"
)
```

      from .autonotebook import tqdm as notebook_tqdm


The ``register_script`` method can be used to register the workflow.


```python
from flytekit.configuration import ImageConfig

from feast_workflow import feast_workflow

wf = remote.register_script(
    feast_workflow,
    image_config=ImageConfig.from_images(
        "ghcr.io/flyteorg/flytecookbook:feast_integration-latest"
    ),
    version="v2",
    source_path="../",
    module_name="feast_workflow",
)
```

## 02: Launch an execution

FlyteRemote provides convenient methods to retrieve version of the pipeline from the remote server.

**NOTE**: It is possible to get a specific version of the workflow and trigger a launch for that, but let's just get the latest.


```python
lp = remote.fetch_launch_plan(name="feast_integration.feast_workflow.feast_workflow")
lp.id.version
```




    'v1'



The ``execute`` method can be used to execute a Flyte entity — a launch plan in our case.


```python
execution = remote.execute(
    lp,
    inputs={"num_features_univariate": 5},
    wait=True
)
```

## 03. Sync an execution

You can sync an execution to retrieve the workflow's outputs. ``sync_nodes`` is set to True to retrieve the intermediary nodes' outputs as well.

**NOTE**: It is possible to fetch an existing execution or simply retrieve an already commenced execution. Also, if you launch an execution with the same name, Flyte will respect that and not restart a new execution!


```python
from flytekit.models.core.execution import WorkflowExecutionPhase

synced_execution = remote.sync(execution, sync_nodes=True)
print(f"Execution {synced_execution.id.name} is in {WorkflowExecutionPhase.enum_to_string(synced_execution.closure.phase)} phase")
```

    Execution f218aba055ba34a3fb75 is in SUCCEEDED phase

## 04. Retrieve the output

Fetch the model and the model prediction.


```python
model = synced_execution.outputs["o0"]
prediction = synced_execution.outputs["o1"]
prediction
```




    /var/folders/6r/9pdkgpkd5nx1t34ndh1f_3q80000gn/T/flyteaqx6tlyu/control_plane_metadata/local_flytekit/e1a690494fe33da04a4dca7737096234/0c81c76dc3a029267a96f275431b5bc5.npy



**NOTE**: The output model is available locally as a JobLibSerialized file, which can be downloaded and loaded.


```python
model
```




    /var/folders/6r/9pdkgpkd5nx1t34ndh1f_3q80000gn/T/flyteaqx6tlyu/control_plane_metadata/local_flytekit/91246ef2160dde99a7512ab3aa9aa2ce/model.joblib.dat



Fetch the ``repo_config``.


```python
repo_config = synced_execution.node_executions["n0"].outputs["o0"]
```

## 05. Generate predictions

Re-use the `predict` function from the workflow to generate predictions — Flytekit will automatically manage the IO for you!

### Load features from the online feature store


```python
import os

from feast_workflow import predict, FEAST_FEATURES, retrieve_online

inference_point = retrieve_online(
    repo_config=repo_config,
    online_store=synced_execution.node_executions["n4"].outputs["o0"],
    data_point=533738,
)
inference_point
```




    {'total protein': [70.0],
     'peripheral pulse': [3.0],
     'nasogastric reflux PH': [4.718545454545455],
     'surgical lesion': ['1'],
     'rectal temperature': [38.17717842323652],

     'Hospital Number': ['533738'],
     'packed cell volume': [43.0],
     'outcome': ['1'],
     'abdominal distension': [4.0]}


### Generate a prediction


```python
predict(model_ser=model, features=inference_point)
```
