# Compound AI Systems

Compound AI Systems refer to artificial intelligence systems that combine multiple

focusing on a single model or data type, Compound AI Systems combine models with
different modalities and software components like databases, vector stores, and
more to solve a given task or problem.

In the following examples, you’ll explore how Compound AI Systems can be applied
to manipulate and analyze various types of data.
