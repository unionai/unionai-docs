# Securely run LLM-generated code

This example demonstrates how to run code generated by a large language model (LLM) using a `ContainerTask`.
The agent takes a user’s question, generates Flyte 2 code using the Flyte 2 documentation as context, and runs it in an isolated container.
If the execution fails, the agent reflects on the error and retries
up to a configurable limit until it succeeds.

Using `ContainerTask` ensures that all generated code runs in a secure environment.
This gives you full flexibility to execute arbitrary logic safely and reliably.

## What this example demonstrates

- How to combine LLM generation with programmatic execution.
- How to run untrusted or dynamically generated code securely.
- How to iteratively improve code using agent-like behavior.

## Setting up the agent environment

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment for the agent task.
This example follows the `uv` script format to declare dependencies.

```
# /// script
# requires-python = "==3.13"
# dependencies = [
#    "flyte>=0.2.0b33",
#    "langchain-core==0.3.66",
#    "langchain-openai==0.3.24",
#    "langchain-community==0.3.26",
#    "beautifulsoup4==4.13.4",
#    "docker==7.1.0",
# ]
# ///
```

> ```
> flyte create secret openai_api_key <YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
> ```

We store the LLM-generated code in a structured format. This allows us to:

- Enforce consistent formatting
- Make debugging easier
- Log and analyze generations systematically

By capturing metadata alongside the raw code, we maintain transparency and make it easier to iterate or trace issues over time.

{{< code file="/external/unionai-examples/tutorials-v2/code_runner/agent.py" fragment=code_base_model lang=python >}}

We then define a state model to persist the agent's history across iterations. This includes previous messages,
generated code, and any errors encountered.

Maintaining this history allows the agent to reflect on past attempts, avoid repeating mistakes,
and iteratively improve the generated code.

## Retrieve docs

We define a task to load documents from a given URL and concatenate them into a single string.
This string is then used as part of the LLM prompt.

We set `max_depth = 20` to avoid loading an excessive number of documents.
However, even with this limit, the resulting context can still be quite large.
To handle this, we use an LLM (GPT-4 in this case) that supports extended context windows.

> [!NOTE]
> Appending all documents into a single string can result in extremely large contexts, potentially exceeding the LLM’s token limit.
> If your dataset grows beyond what a single prompt can handle, there are a couple of strategies you can use.
> One option is to apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where you chunk the documents, embed them using a model,
> store the vectors in a vector database, and retrieve only the most relevant pieces at inference time.
>
> An alternative approach is to pass references to full files into the prompt, allowing the LLM to decide which files are most relevant based
> on natural-language search over file paths, summaries, or even contents. This method assumes that only a subset of files
> will be necessary for a given task, and the LLM is responsible for navigating the structure and identifying what to read.
> While this can be a lighter-weight solution for smaller datasets, its effectiveness depends on how well the LLM can
> reason over file references and the reliability of its internal search heuristics.

## Code generation

Next, we define a utility function to construct the LLM chain responsible for generating Python code from user input. This chain leverages
a LangChain `PromptTemplate` to structure the input and an OpenAI chat model to generate well-formed, Flyte 2-compatible Python scripts.

{{< code file="/external/unionai-examples/tutorials-v2/code_runner/agent.py" fragment=generate_code_gen_chain lang=python >}}

We then define a `generate` task responsible for producing the code solution.
To improve clarity and testability, the output is structured in three parts:
a short summary of the generated solution, a list of necessary imports,
and the main body of executable code.

{{< code file="/external/unionai-examples/tutorials-v2/code_runner/agent.py" fragment=generate lang=python >}}

A `ContainerTask` then executes this code in an isolated container environment.
It takes the code as input, runs it safely, and returns the program’s output and exit code.

{{< code file="/external/unionai-examples/tutorials-v2/code_runner/agent.py" fragment=code_runner_task lang=python >}}

This task verifies that the generated code runs as expected.
It tests the import statements first, then executes the full code.
It records the output and any error messages in the agent state for further analysis.

{{< code file="/external/unionai-examples/tutorials-v2/code_runner/agent.py" fragment=code_check lang=python >}}

If an error occurs, a separate task reflects on the failure and generates a response.
This reflection is added to the agent state to guide future iterations.

{{< code file="/external/unionai-examples/tutorials-v2/code_runner/agent.py" fragment=reflect lang=python >}}

Finally, we define a `main` task that runs the code agent and orchestrates the steps above.
If the code execution fails, we reflect on the error and retry until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

{{< code file="/external/unionai-examples/tutorials-v2/code_runner/agent.py" fragment=main lang=python >}}

## Running the code agent

If things are working properly, you should see output similar to the following:

```
---GENERATING CODE SOLUTION---
---CHECKING CODE---
---CODE BLOCK CHECK: PASSED---
---NO CODE TEST FAILURES---
---DECISION: FINISH---
In this solution, we define two tasks using Flyte v2.
The first task, `oomer`, is designed to simulate an out-of-memory (OOM) error by attempting to allocate a large list.
The second task, `failure_recovery`, attempts to execute `oomer` and catches any OOM errors.
If an OOM error is caught, it retries the `oomer` task with increased memory resources.
This pattern demonstrates how to handle resource-related exceptions and dynamically adjust task configurations in Flyte workflows.

import asyncio
import flyte
import flyte.errors
env = flyte.TaskEnvironment(name="oom_example", resources=flyte.Resources(cpu=1, memory="250Mi"))

@env.task
async def oomer(x: int):
    large_list = [0] * 100000000  # Simulate OOM
    print(len(large_list))

@env.task
async def always_succeeds() -> int:
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return 42

...
```

You can run the code agent on a Flyte/Union cluster using the following command:

```
uv run --prerelease=allow agent.py
```
