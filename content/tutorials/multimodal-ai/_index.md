# Multimodal AI

Multimodal AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that process and integrate information from multiple types of data or sensory inputs, such as text, images, video, and audio. Instead of focusing on a single data type, multimodal AI combines different modalities to create a richer, more comprehensive understanding of a given task or problem.

In the following examples, you’ll explore how multimodal AI can be applied to manipulate and analyze various types of data.
