## Contributing to documentation

Union AI maintains and hosts both Flyte and Union documentation at [www.union.ai/docs](https://www.union.ai/docs).
The two sets of documentation are deeply integrated, as the Union product is built on top of Flyte.
To better maintain both sets of docs, they are hosted in the same repository (but rendered so that you can choose to view one or the other).

Both the Flyte and Union documentation are open source.
Flyte community members and Union customers are both welcome to contribute to the documentation.

If you are interested, see [Contributing documentation and examples](./contributing-docs/_index).
