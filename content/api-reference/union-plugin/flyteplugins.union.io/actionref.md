# ActionRef

**Package:** `flyteplugins.union.io`

Provenance: the action (one task execution within a run) that
produced a particular `Volume` version, plus the output slot it
was returned as.

Stamped at reseal time (commit / fork / finalize) onto ``produced_by``,
and carried onto the next version's ``parent_produced_by`` so lineage
is navigable. Mirrors the fields of `flyte.models.ActionID` so the
explore TUI / lineage tooling can attribute each version to the run and
action that created it, and jump to that action's logs.

``locator`` is the object-store path of *this* version's published
metadata object (see `_publish_metadata`). It's what makes lineage
walkable offline and at full fidelity: every published version — including
intra-action intermediates that were never task outputs — is addressable,
so ``parent_produced_by.locator`` loads the parent's complete Volume value,
whose own ``parent_produced_by.locator`` continues the chain.

``output_name`` (e.g. ``"o0"``) is the task output the value was returned
as. Only the value actually returned from a task has one (filled in by the
type transformer); intermediates leave it ``None``. It deep-links to a
specific output in the action UI — complementary to ``locator``.


## Parameters

```python
class ActionRef(
    name: str,
    run_name: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    project: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    domain: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    org: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    output_name: typing.Optional[str] = None,
    locator: typing.Optional[str] = None,
)
```
Create a new model by parsing and validating input data from keyword arguments.

Raises [`ValidationError`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/pydantic_core/#pydantic_core.ValidationError) if the input data cannot be
validated to form a valid model.

`self` is explicitly positional-only to allow `self` as a field name.
