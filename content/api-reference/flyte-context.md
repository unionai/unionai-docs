# LLM context documents

The following documents provide a LLM context for authoring and running Flyte/Union workflows.
They can serve as a reference for LLM-based AI assistants to understand how to properly write, configure, and execute Flyte/Union workflows.

* **Full documentation content**: The entire documentation (this site) for {{<key product_name >}} version 1.0 in a single text file.
  * {{< download "/_static/public/llms-full.txt" llms-full.txt >}}

* **Concise context document**: A concise overview of Flyte 1.0 concepts.
  * {{< download "/_static/public/llms-concise.txt" llms-concise.txt >}}

You can then add either or both to the context window of your LLM-based AI assistant to help it better understand Flyte/Union development.
