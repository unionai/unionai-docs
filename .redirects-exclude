# Patterns for deleted content pages that don't need redirects.
# One path pattern per line, relative to repo root.
# Supports fnmatch glob patterns (e.g. content/api-reference/*)
# Lines starting with # are comments. Empty lines are ignored.

# Auto-generated API reference pages (regenerated each build)
content/api-reference/*

# Internal docs builder tooling
content/__docs_builder__/*

# Legacy deletions predating the introduction of this check.
# These sections were restructured during the v1 -> v2 migration.
