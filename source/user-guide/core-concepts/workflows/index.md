# Workflows

So far in our discussion of workflows, we have focused on top-level workflows decorated with `@union.workflow`.
These are, in fact, more accurately termed [standard workflows](./standard-workflows.md) to differentiate them from the other types of workflows that exist in {@= Product =@}: [subworkflows](./subworkflows-and-sub-launch-plans.md), [dynamic workflows](./dynamic-workflows), [imperative workflows](./imperative-workflows.md),  and [eager workflows](./eager-workflows.md).

In this section, we will delve deeper into the fundamentals of all of these workflow types, including their syntax, structure, and behavior.
