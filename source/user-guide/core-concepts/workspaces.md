# Workspaces

Workspaces provide a convenient VSCode development environment for iterating on
your Union.ai tasks, workflows, and apps.

With workspaces, you can:

- 🧑‍💻 Develop and debug your tasks, workflows, or code in general
- ▶️ Run your tasks and workflows in a way that matches your production environment
- 🚀 Deploy your workflows and apps to development, staging, or production environments
- 🗂️ Persist files across workspace restarts to save your work
- 🔑 Specify secrets and resources for your workspace
- 🐳 Specify custom container images
- 💻 Specify custom `on_startup` commands
- ⏱️ Adjust the idle time-to-live (TTL) for your workspace to avoid unneeded expenses
- 🔑 Authenticate with GitHub to clone private repositories

## Creating a workspace

To create a workspace, click on the `Workspace` tab on left navbar and click
on the `New Workspace` button on the top right.

![Create Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/create-new-workspace-1.png)

Provide a name for your workspace, set an **Idle TTL** (time to live), and
click `Create`.

![Create Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/create-new-workspace-2.png)

```{note}
The Idle TTL is the amount of time a workspace will be idle before it is
automatically stopped. Workspaces have a global TTL of 1 day, but you can set
the idle TTL field to a shorter duration to stop the workspace sooner.
```

You should see a new workspace created in the Workspaces view:

![Create Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/create-new-workspace-3.png)


## Running a workspace

To run a workspace, click on the switch on the workspace item:

![Run Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/run-workspace-1.png)

Once the workspace has started, you can click on the `Open in VSCode` button:

![Run Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/run-workspace-2.png)

Once the startup commands have completed, you'll see a browser-based VSCode IDE:

![Run Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/run-workspace-3.png)

To stop a workspace, click on the toggle switch on the workspace item.

## Filesystem Persistence

Any changes to the filesystem that you make in the working directory of your
workspace (the directory you find yourself in when you first open the workspace)
are persisted across workspace restarts.

This allows you to save data, code, models, and other files in your workspace.

```{note}
Storing large datasets, models, and other files in your workspace may slow down
the start and stop times of your workspace. This is because the workspace
instance needs time to download/upload the files from persistent storage.
```

## Editing a workspace

Change the workspace configuration by clicking on the `Edit` button:

![Edit Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/edit-workspace-1.png)

Note that you can change everything except the workspace name.

![Edit Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/edit-workspace-2.png)


## The workspace detail view

Clicking on the workspace item on the list view will reveal the workspace detail view,
which provides all the information about the workspace.

![Workspace Detail](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/workspace-detail.png)


## Archiving a workspace

Archive a workspace by clicking on the `Archive` button:

![Archive Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/archive-workspace.png)

Show archived workspaces by clicking on the `Show archived` toggle
on the top right of the workspaces list view. Unarchive a workspace by clicking
on the `Unarchive` button:

![Unarchive Workspace](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/unarchive-workspace.png)


## Workspace CLI Commands

The `union` CLI also provides commands for managing workspaces.

### Create a workspace configuration

The first step is to create a yaml file that describes the workspace.

```{code-block} shell
union create workspace-config --init base_image workspace.yaml
```

This will create a `workspace.yaml` file in the current directory, with the
default configuration values that you can edit for your needs:

```{code-block} yaml
name: my-workspace
description: my workspace description
project: <project>
domain: <domain>
container_image: public.ecr.aws/unionai/workspace-base:py3.11-latest
resources:
    cpu: "2"
    mem: "4Gi"
    gpu: null
accelerator: null
on_startup: null
ttl_seconds: 1200
```

Note that the yaml file contains a `project` and `domain` field that you can set to create a
workspace in a specific project and domain.

### Create a workspace

Then, create a workspace using the `union create workspace` command:

```{code-block} shell 
union create workspace workspace.yaml
```

This command will also start your workspace, and will print out the workspace
link that you click on to open the workspace in your browser:

```{code-block} text
Created: workspace_definition {
  ...
}

Starting workspace 'my-workspace'

🚀 Workspace started: Open VSCode in Browser
```

### Stop a workspace

When you want to stop a workspace, use the `union stop workspace` command:

```{code-block} shell
union stop workspace --name my-workspace
```

This will print out a message indicating that the workspace has been stopped:

```{code-block} text
Workspace instance stopped: org: "org"
...
```

### Update a workspace

To update a workspace, modify the `workspace.yaml` file and run the
`union update workspace` command:

```{code-block} shell
union update workspace workspace.yaml
```

This will print out a message that looks something like:

```{code-block} text
Updated: workspace_definition {
  ...
}
```


### Get existing workspaces

To get existing workspaces, use the `union get workspace` command:

```{code-block} shell
union get workspace
```

This will print out a table of all the workspaces you have access to in the
specified project and domain (the command uses the default project and domain
if you don't provide them).

```{code-block} text
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Workspace name       ┃ CPU ┃ Memory ┃ GPU ┃ Accelerator         ┃ TTL Seconds ┃ Active URL ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ my-workspace         │ 2   │ 4Gi    │ -   │ -                   │ 1200        │ -          │
└──────────────────────┴─────┴────────┴─────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────┴────────────┘
```

To get the details of a specific workspace, provide
the workspace name with the `--name` flag.

### Start a workspace

To start a workspace, use the `union start workspace` command, specifying the
name of the workspace you want to start in the `--name` flag.

```{code-block} shell
union start workspace --name my-workspace
```

You should see a message that looks like:

```{code-block} text
Starting workspace 'my-workspace'

🚀 Workspace started: Open VSCode in Browser
```


## Customizing a workspace

There are several settings that you can customize for a workspace in the UI or
the CLI.

### Setting secrets

If you don't have any secrets yet, create them with the `union create secret`
command:

```{code-block} shell
union create secret --project my_project --domain my_domain --name my_secret
```

You'll be prompted to enter a secret value in the terminal:

```
Enter secret value: ...
```

```{note}
You can learn more about secrets management [here](../../development-cycle/managing-secrets.md).
```

Set secrets for your workspace by clicking on the `Secrets` tab in the sidebar.
Provide the `my_secret` key and optionally, the environment variable you want
to assign it to in the workspace.

![Secrets](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/setting-secrets.png)

#### Setting secrets via the CLI

Set secrets via the CLI using the `secrets` key, which is a list of objects with
a `key` and `env_var` (optional) field:

```{code-block} yaml
name: my-workspace
description: my workspace description
project: flytesnacks
domain: development
container_image: public.ecr.aws/unionai/workspace-base:py3.11-latest
secrets:
    - key: my_secret  # this is the secret key you set when you create the secret
      env_var: MY_SECRET  # this is an optional environment variable that you
                          # can bind the secret value onto.
...
```


### Setting resources

You can also set the resources for your workspace:

![Resources](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/setting-resources.png)

{@@ if serverless @@}

These resources must be compatible with the resource limits available to you
on your Union.ai serverless account. Go the the top-level dashboard to view your
execution settings:

![Execution Settings](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/serverless-execution-settings.png)

For the `GPU` field, you can choose from the [available accelerators](../tasks/task-hardware-environment/accelerators.md).

{@@ elif  byoc @@}

These resources must be compatible with the resources available to your BYOC
cluster. Find the details of your BYOC cluster in the top-level dashboard:

![BYOC Compute Resources](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/byoc-compute-resources.png)

You can choose [the GPU accelerator](../tasks/task-hardware-environment/accelerators.md) that corresponds to your available instance types.

{@@ endif @@}


### Specifying custom `on_startup` commands

If you need to run any commands like install additional dependencies or `wget`
a file from the web, specify custom `on_startup` commands:

![On Startup](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/customize-onstartup.png)

### Specifying custom container images

By default, the workspace will use a Union.ai-provided container image which contains
the following Python libraries:

- `union`
- `flytekit`
- `uv`
- `ipykernel`
- `pandas`
- `pyarrow`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

#### Specifying a custom container image in the UI

You can specify a pre-built custom container image by clicking on the `Container`
tab in the sidebar and provide the image name in the workspace creation form.

```{note}
The minimum requirement for custom images is that it contains `union>=0.1.166`
installed.
```

![Custom Container](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/customize-container-image.png)

In many cases, you may want to use the same container image as a task execution
that you want to debug. You can find the container image URI by going to the
task execution details page:

![Task Execution](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/customize-container-image-get-uri.png)

{@@ if byoc @@}

You can specify:
- Any public container image URI
- Images built with the Union.ai [image builder service](../development-cycle/image-spec.md)
- Images available in your private container registry (e.g. [AWS ECR](../integrations/enabling-aws-resources/enabling-aws-ecr.md), [GCP Artifact Registry](../integrations/enabling-gcp-resources/enabling-google-artifact-registry.md), or [Azure Container Registry](../integrations/enabling-azure-resources/enabling-azure-container-registry.md))

{@@ endif @@}

#### Specifying a custom container image in the CLI

The `union` CLI provides a way to specify a custom container image that's built
by Union's image builder service. To do this, run the following command:

```{code-block} shell
union create workspace-config --init custom_image workspace.yaml
```

This will create a `workspace.yaml` file with a `container_image` image key
that supports the [ImageSpec](../development-cycle/image-spec.md) arguments.
When you run the `union create workspace` command with this `workspace.yaml` file,
it will first build the image before creating the workspace definition.


## Authenticating with GitHub

If you want to clone a private GitHub repository into your workspace, you can
using the pre-installed `gh` CLI to authenticate your workspace session:

```{code-block} shell
gh auth login
```

You'll be prompted to enter either a GitHub personal access token (PAT) or
authenticate via the browser.

```{note}
You can create and set a `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret to set the access token for your
workspace, but you'll need to authenticate via `gh auth login` in every new
workspace session:

- Create a secret with the `union create secret` command
- Create a workspace or update an existing one with the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret,
  setting the environment variable to e.g. `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- In the workspace session, run `gh auth login` to authenticate with GitHub and
  use the `$GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable as the personal access token.
```

## Sorting and filtering workspaces

You can filter workspaces to only the active ones by clicking on the `Active`
toggle on the top left of the workspaces list view.

![Active Workspaces](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/active-workspaces.png)

Sort by recently updated by clicking on the `Recently updated` toggle on the
top right of the workspaces list view, and you can also sort by recently
updated by clicking on the `Recently updated` toggle on the top right of the
workspaces list view.

![Filtering and Sorting Workspaces](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/filtering-sorting-workspaces.png)

## Troubleshooting

You may come across issues starting up a workspace due to various reasons,
including:

- Resource requests not being available on your Union cluster.
- Secrets key typpos of not being defined on the project/domain.
- Container image typos or container images not existing.

Under the hood, workspaces are powered by Union tasks, so to debug these kinds
of issues, the workspace detail page provides a link to the underlying
task that's hosting the VSCode IDE:

![Workspace Detail](/_static/images/user-guide/core-concepts/workspaces/failed-workspace-detail.png)

Clicking on the link will open the task details page, where you can see the
underlying task definition, pod events, and logs to debug further.
