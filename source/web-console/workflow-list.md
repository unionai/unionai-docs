You can search the list by name and filter for only those that are archived.
To archive a workflow, select the archive icon ![Archive icon](/_static/images/archive-icon.png).

* **Last execution time**:
The time of the most recent execution of this workflow.
* **Last 10 executions**:
The status of the last 10 executions of this workflow.
* **Inputs**:
The input type for the workflow.
* **Outputs**:
The output type for the workflow.
* **Description**:
 The description of the workflow.

Select an entry on the list to go to that [specific workflow](workflow-view).
