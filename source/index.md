# Introduction

The Union workflow orchestration platform is based on the [Flyte](https://flyte.org) open-source project.

Flyte is already used by hundreds of major organizations to run machine learning and data pipelines. It handles everything from simple processing jobs to complex multi-step workflows that span multiple teams and use specialized hardware and infrastructure.

However, Flyte requires a team of platform engineers to maintain, extend, and scale.

Union abstracts away the infrastructure, providing a turnkey system that lets your ML engineers and data scientists focus on what they do best without the need for a dedicated team to manage the platform.

Union also extends Flyte by adding features that improve the development experience, enhance performance and scalability, and enable more efficient use of compute resources. See [Union overview](union-overview) for more details.
